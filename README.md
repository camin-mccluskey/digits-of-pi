# digits-of-pi

Inspired by Grant Sanderson's (3Blue1Brown) YouTube video demonstrating how the digits of Pi appear from counting the perfectly elastic collisions of 2 blocks of mass ratio 1:100^(digits-1), on a frictionless plane. Try it out [here](https://camin-mccluskey.github.io/digits-of-pi/)! Built using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).
